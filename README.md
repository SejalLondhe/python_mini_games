# Python Mini Games Collection

This repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly, text-based games built with Python. These games are designed to be simple, fun, and educational â€” perfect for learning Python basics such as conditionals, loops, functions, and user input handling.

> **Note:** These are some of my earlier (old) projects that I created to enhance and practice my core Python skills through hands-on mini games.
